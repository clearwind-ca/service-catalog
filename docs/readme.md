Service Catalog is an open source tool to help understand the complex set of teams and services that make up a complex service.

Project goals:
* Provide clarity on what teams, services and components make up the service.
* Provide tools to improve time to mitigate in incidents.
* Provide visibility into key changes in the system.

At the center of this is, configuration through code. Rather than providing an interface to add configuration, this is done as close to the code as possible. As such files are stored in repositories on GitHub and pulled into the catalog.

The Service Catalog is available under the [MIT license](../license.md).
